<h2>Why Remineralize?</h2>
<h4><u>Healthy soil, healthy crops, healthy people</u></h4>
  <br>
<ul>
<li>Rock dust increases plant biomass, <mark>increasing crop yeilds</mark>.</li>
<br>
  <li>Rock dust <mark>increases the nutitional value of crops</mark> (you need to eat
  five apples today to have the same nutrition of one apple in 1965!)
  With remineralization: higher brix counts, better flavor, and
  increased nutritional density to foods. This means better physical
  and mental health for humans, animals, and ecosystems.</li>
<br>
  <li>Rock dust increases <mark>resilience of plants</mark> to weather
  extremes. Rock dust increases soil health and micro-organism
  populations, and as a result <mark>chemical pesticides and
  fertilizers are not needed</mark>. Increasing plant resilience
  prevents soil erosion and desertification, increasing the amount of
  productive and green land on Earth.</li>
<br>
  <li>By restoring a natural soil ecosystem, mineral blends can help to
  <mark>repair soil</mark> that has been damaged by chemical pesticides or
  fertilizers.</li>
<br>
  <li>Rock dust <mark>mimics natural mineralization</mark> that occurs through
  glaciation, which is why a post-ice-age world is so fertile. Through
  time and farming practices over the millenia, glacial mineralization
  has being depleted. The addition minerals from various geological
  areas increases the productivity and resiliance of the
  land. Minerals remain in the soil for decades+, so it is not
  necessary to repeat every year.</li>
  <br>
  </ul>
  <h4><u>Carbon Sequestration</u></h4>
  <br>
  <ul>
  <li>Remineralization must play a major role in climate change mitigation
  and ecosystem repair. <mark>Soil is the only place on earth where it is
  feasible to store large amounts of Carbon</mark> that we need to draw down
  from the atmosphere. Carbon is a <i>beneficial</i> component of
  soil, increasing fertility and water retention.</li>
<br>
  <li><mark>Rock dust sequesters CO2</mark> in two main ways: by increasing plant
  biomass (capturing CO2 through photosynthesis) and by rock
  weathering (chemically capturing CO2 and locking it into soil).</li>
<br>
  <li>The amount of Carbon per year cycled in and out of the atmosphere
  through plant photosynthesis and respiration is an order of
  magnitude more than the amount released by human activity each year.
  <mark>Mother nature's carbon machines are already much more massive than
  any machine we could build to suck CO2</mark>, and proven over millions of
  years to work. Working with natural processes to maximize the
  biomass of plants, as well as managing the soil so that their
  biomass is retained, is the <mark>most effective and cost-effective way of
  drawing CO2 out of the atmosphere</mark>.</li>
  <br>
  </ul>
